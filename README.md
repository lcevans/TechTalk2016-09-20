Introduction to Game Networking via a Multiplayer SpaceWar game.
(Modified from the PewPewPew Hackday Project from AdRoll Hackweek Q3 2016)


We build the game up through a series of "Stages" (Subdirectories of this repo)

Stage0: A simple chat room server.
Stage1: Server side for dumb terminal approach.
Stage2: Add client side for dumb terminal approach. (Working game)
