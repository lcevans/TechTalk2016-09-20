# Stage 2 (Working version)

This Stage adds the game client as well.

Run the server with `python server.py --port 6666`

Connect the game client with `python client.py --host localhost --port 6666` to start playing.
Use the arrow keys to move and space to fire.

You can connect multiple clients, even from other computers provided they can reach the server.
